# DevNET Project 4: Ansible Network Automation
This project involved automating the addition of a VLAN and grabbing the configuration files for each Cisco device on the network. There were two team members for this project, and we collaborated in person with our code being shared over GitHub. Due to issues with the second team member's computer, the first member did most of the commits while we collaborated in person. 

For our project, we utilized one router, one switch, and both of our computers. Team member 1 wrote configurations for the devices and member 2 did the basic Ansible files, which were later refined to their current states. Configuration and network layout is listed in the documentation folder, while our Ansible playbooks are in the playbooks folder. 

It is recommended that you create a Python virtual environment if you cannot install Ansible system-wide (such as Ubuntu over WSL).
